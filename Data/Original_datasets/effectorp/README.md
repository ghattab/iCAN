# Apoplastic and cytoplasmic effectors vs. non-effectors

##### Description 

    The dataset is taken from [1], also used in [2] and downloaded from https://github.com/JanaSperschneider/EffectorP-3.0-Data. The positive examples consist of apoplastic and cytoplasmic effectors from fungi and oomycetes (from the fasta files "EffectorsApoplastic_noHomology.fasta", "EffectorsCytoplasmic_noHomology.fasta"). Negative examples consist of secreted fungal saprophyte proteins and secreted proteins from brown algae ("ALL_SAPROPHYTE_BROWNALGAE_SECRETOMES_noHomology.fasta").
